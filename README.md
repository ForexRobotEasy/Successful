/* 
This code represents a simple expert advisor (EA) for the MetaTrader 5 (MT5) trading platform. The EA is designed to perform automated trading based on a proprietary strategy. It uses historical market data to analyze the market trend, generate trading signals, and execute trades.

The code starts with the necessary header information, including copyright and version details, as well as a backlink to the Forex Robot Easy website.

The OnInit() function is called during the EA's initialization. It initializes the trade execution module and checks if it was successful. If not, an error message is printed.

The OnDeinit() function is called when the EA is being deinitialized. It deinitializes the trade execution module.

The OnTick() function is called on every tick of the price data. It performs the core logic of the EA, including analyzing the market trend, generating trading signals, and executing trades based on those signals.

The AnalyzeMarketTrend() function is responsible for analyzing the market trend using historical data. It currently uses a placeholder value of 0.5, which should be replaced with the actual analysis logic.

The GenerateTradingSignal() function generates a trading signal based on the proprietary strategy. It currently uses a placeholder value of 1, which should be replaced with the actual signal generation logic.

The ExecuteTrades() function executes trades based on the generated signal. It checks if trade execution is allowed, and if so, opens a position based on the signal. The position size is fixed at 0.1 lots, and the take profit and stop loss levels are defined by the constants TAKE_PROFIT and STOP_LOSS.

The OnStart() function is called when the EA is started. It calls the MonitorTrades() function, which is responsible for real-time monitoring of trades and performance analysis.

The MonitorTrades() function runs in a loop until the EA is stopped. It performs real-time monitoring and analysis of trades, taking necessary actions as required. Currently, it sleeps for 1 second between each check.
